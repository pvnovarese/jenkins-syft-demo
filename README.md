# Demo: Integrating Jenkins with Syft

## NOTE: deprecated

this is an old demo, I'm leaving it here for a while but I'm going to delete it eventually.

there is a new, better demo here: https://github.com/pvnovarese/syft-demo




This is a very rough demo of integrating Syft with Jenkins.  If you don't know what Syft is, read up here: https://github.com/anchore/syft

## Part 1: Jenkins Setup

We're going to run jenkins in a container to make this fairly self-contained and easily disposable.  This command will run jenkins and bind to the host's docker sock (if you don't know what that means, don't worry about it, it's not important).

`$ docker run -u root -d --name jenkins --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /tmp/jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home jenkinsci/blueocean
`

and we'll need to install jq in the jenkins container:

`$ docker exec jenkins apk add jq`

Once Jenkins is up and running, we have just a few things to configure:
- Get the initial password (`$ docker logs jenkins`)
- log in on port 8080
- Unlock Jenkins using the password from the logs
- Select “Install Selected Plugins” and create an admin user
- Create a credential so we can push images into Docker Hub:
	- go to manage jenkins -> manage credentials
	- click “global” and “add credentials”
	- Use your Docker Hub username and password (get an access token from Docker Hub if you are using multifactor authentication), and set the ID of the credential to “Docker Hub”.

## Part 2: Get Syft
We can download the syft and grype binaries directly into our running container:

```
$ docker exec --user=root jenkins bash -c 'curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/syft/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin'
$ docker exec --user=root jenkins bash -c 'curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/grype/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin'
```

NB: these are only installed into the running container, not the image, so if you recreate the jenkins container, you'll need to re-download these.

## Part 3: A Simple Package Stoplist

Now we’ll set up a simple package stoplist with syft:

- Fork this repo
- In the Jenkinsfile, change this line, replacing “pvnovarese” with your Docker ID:
	`repository = 'pvnovarese/jenkins-syft-demo'`
- From the jenkins main page, select “New Item” 
- Name it “jenkins-syft-demo”
- Choose “pipeline” and click “OK”
- On the configuration page, scroll down to “Pipeline”
- For “Definition,” select “Pipeline script from SCM”
- For “SCM,” select “git”
- For “Repository URL,” paste in the URL of your forked github repo
	e.g. https://github.com/pvnovarese/jenkins-syft-demo (with your github user ID)
- Click “Save”
- You’ll now be at the top-level project page.  Click “Build Now”

Jenkins will check out the repo and build an image using the provided Dockerfile.  This image will be a simple copy of the alpine base image with curl added.  Once the image is built, Jenkins will call Syft and then grep through the output to search for curl.  This should cause the pipeline to fail at the “Analyze with Syft” stage.

You can check the console output for the build if you want to see where the failure occurs.

If you’d like to see a successful build, go to the github repo, edit the Dockerfile, and change curl to wget, then go back to the Jenkins project page and click “Build now” again. This time, once the image passes our Syft check, jenkins will rebuild the image, using the “prod” tag this time, and push it to Docker Hub using the credentials you provided.

**Challenge: can you update the Jenkinsfile to check for both curl and wget at the same time?**

## Part 4: Check for CVEs with Grype (optional)
There is a companion repo and demo for Anchore Grype here: https://github.com/pvnovarese/jenkins-grype-demo

## Part 5: Cleanup
- Kill the jenkins container (it will automatically be removed since we specified --rm when we created it):
	`pvn@gyarados /home/pvn> docker kill jenkins`
- Remove the jenkins-data directory from /tmp
	`pvn@gyarados /home/pvn> sudo rm -rf /tmp/jenkins-data/`
- Remove all demo images from your local machine:
	`pvn@gyarados /home/pvn> docker image ls | grep -E "jenkins-grype-demo|jenkins-syft-demo" | awk '{print $3}' | xargs docker image rm -f`
